GIF Creator Python Program

Description

This Python program allows you to easily create GIF images from a set of individual images. 


Follow these simple steps to create your GIF:

1) Create a folder where you want to store your GIF file. You can name it anything you like, but ensure to remember the folder name.

2) Place all the images you want to include in your GIF into the folder created in step 1.

3) Open the gifCreator.py file in a text editor.
Locate the "PATH" variable in the script and set it to the same folder name you created in step 1. This is where your program will look for the images.

4) Execute the gifCreator.py file in your Python environment.

5) Once the script finishes running, your GIF will be created in the same folder as your images.
